## ABSTRACT
</div>
<div align="justify"> 
A sensorimotor skill can be defined as a sequence of continuous motions produced by the human body in response to external stimuli. Periodontal probing is an example of a sensorimotor skill, that involves the periodic insertion of a periodontal probe between the tooth and gingiva with the purpose of diagnosing a periodontal disease (periodontitis). The goal of the project is to study the professional sensorimotor skill of periodontal probing from the Deep Learning perspective using the dental professional's recordings collected with the VR dental simulation system. In this project, weÂ develop CNN and LSTM models that characterize the sensorimotor skill of periodontal probing by detecting which region of the tooth is probed. We also investigate how far the proposed models are capable of identifying the periodontal pockets. Finally, we discuss the possible challenges and provide a roadmap for future work.
